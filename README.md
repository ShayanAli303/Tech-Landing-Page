HoloDesk â€“ Fictional Holographic Workstation Website This is my 3rd project for the Elevvo internship, where I designed a futuristic product website for HoloDesk, a portable holographic workstation. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features interactive UI elements, scroll animations, responsive design, and dark/light mode.
